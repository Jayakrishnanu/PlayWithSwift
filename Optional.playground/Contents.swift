import UIKit

//
//Problem
//
//Why did the Swift engineers implement optionals?
//
//Swift Rules
//
//Every variable type must be defined (Implicit/Explicit)
//The type is inferred based on the value


var name: String = "Jayakrishnan" //Explicit
let newName = "Vinu" //Implicit

let myAge = 34 //Implicit
let mySon: Int = 1 //Explicit
let myGPA: Double = 60.0 //Explicit
